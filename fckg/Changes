rev 13-Jan_05-11_37

6 June
Upgraded from FCKeditor 2.4.1 to 2.6.6.  2.6.6 includes the scayt spellchecker, which is an in-editor spellchecker.
2.6.6 is the final FCKeditor before the change-over to CKeditor.  The upgrade required bringing the ie and gecko 
javascript files into sync, in particular so that the image and link dialogs open to a larger size.
This upgrade will now be designated fckgLite 07.

7 June 
Added configuration options for turning SCAYT on and off, setting it as auto,  and for selecting SCAYT language . 
Hide language selection button for SpellerPages spell checker when SCAYT is in effect.

9 June
Converted Arabic language file for fckg editing window from BOM to non-BOM (Corrupted image display).
Enabled overflow and scrolling in SCAYT dialog.

10 June
Increased sizes of link and image dialog windows in gecko. Adjusted font sizes in link.html

11 June 
Corrected url in Anteater safe encodig message (meta.php)

5 July 2012
Fix to FCKEditor fck_link.js for IE9, where FCKeditor's Selection.SelectNode() fails to insert link at 
cursor position if text not previously selected. This only comes into play if fckgLite is prevent from
auto-switching IE to IE8 compatibility while in editing mode.

7 July 2012
Fix to FCKeditor fck_image.js for IE9, where FCK.InsertElement failed to insert image at
cursor. (See fck_link 5 July 2012).

9 July
Removed some unnecessary files from distribution and comproessed  old Changs files to zip.

Confined IE image and link fixes to IE9 since FCKeditor will not load in IE10.  Users of IE10
where templates force Standards Mode will have to manually switch to compatibilty mode.
In other cases, fckgLite auto-switches to IE8 compatibility,

23 August
Fixed for smileys in lists where CR was lost if smiley was in li

24 August
fckeditor/dwsmileys.php: set alternate path for ajax access to smiley.conf in debian and ubuntu

25 August
Set IE compatiblity mode to IE=EmulateIE8 in file browser when browserMode > 8 (used writeln in file: fckxml.js).
This was needed by IE 10.

28 August
Implemented option to rewrite FCKeditor smiley URLs when pages are moved to new server. Regex at top of
edit.php:_preprocess.  The URLs are reset on a page by page basis when loaded and saved.  The option
should be turned off except when needed.

16 September 2012
Added experimental handling of tables, attempting to solve problems in rendering complex tables that have multiple col and row spans.
This uses a new configuration option which will turn on the experimenmtal algorithm for all pages, or it can be turned
on, on a per-page basis, either by use of a checkbox or by adding a syntax plugin style switch to the top of the page:
~~COMPLEX_TABLES~~.  Since ~~COMPLEX_TABLES~~ is implemented as a syntax plugin, it will come into effect only after the page
has been saved; before the save, the user should check off the complex tables checkbox.  The logorithm is not perfect, but it is
considerably superior to the standard table-handling parser.

17 September 2012
Minor edit to edit.php

19 September
Created loop in insert_table() that goes through all rows checking for rowspans. Rowspan property of rows array is set to 0 for
all rows where rowspans have been processed, causing them to be ignored on subsequent passes of loop.

Minor edit to edit.php editor form syntax

9 October 2012
Fixed bug where table markup inside code blocks dropped empty cells (edit.php::_preprocess)

20 Nov
Added session_id check to config.php:  in some system setting session which has already been set throws
an error.
Added $mssg="" to FileUpload() in commands.php for SendUploadResults(), without which some systems freeze.
Both of the above occurred on Windows with PHP 5.3

25
Improved mime-type handling in config.php and fckconfig.js

28 Nov
Fixed font tool plugin to work with stricter define checking of current browsers.

29 Nov
Fixed regex which removed precent-escaped backslashes in plugin syntax so that backslashes are
removed only around non-alpha characters, preserving sequences such as \r\n.

30 Nov
Added two  short-cut keys for numbered list: ctrl-+ and ctrl+{.  Both do the same thing.

8 Dec
In edit.php: insert this.is_smiley = false after alt (text form of smiley) is added to results;
prevents corruption of text formats and insertion of javascript 'undefined' when alt is not found
on next time through start()

Dec 21 2012
